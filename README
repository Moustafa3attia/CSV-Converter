Hey there!

This is Moustafa Attia, author of these modules.
These modules were written with intention to produce an auto csv->json & csv->xml file converter.

Simple kickstart:

1. open your terminal (or CMD)
2. navigate to the files directory. You should find 4 python package files named:
	a. main.py (main converter)
	b. helperModule.py (has some helper functions. I didn't have enough time to make optimal use of these functions but I have intention to complete and re-push)
	c. dataSavingModule.py (has saving/file validation functions those form the second phase of the system)
	d. unitTestModule.py (has unit testing functions. Also, I'm yet to fully test functions such as helperModule functions but we'll get to that in another version)
	e. testFile.json (don't touch as this is made for unit testing purpose)
	f. testFile.xml (don't touch as this is made for unit testing purpose)
	g. transactions.csv (don't touch as this is made for unit testing & sample running purpose)
	h. and finally this README file

3. Now, as you navigated successfully to here, you would want to run unit tests using this command:

>> python unitTestModule.py

You'll get a pretty report that walks through some unit tests I've made myself

4. Now as you made sure functions work properly, you would want to run actual program (on our target transactions.csv file):

>> python main.py transactions.csv string string number string

You'll get prettified report walking along the CSV file and saving each row to both a new "new.json" and a new "new.xml" files those will be generated once you run this command.

Please be informed that running this command more than once will append (in a proper way) to these files so just don't manipulate them manually as this case is not handled.

Also, feel free to play with the cmd line arguments sent through the main program run. Everything hopefully is handled.

Best Regards,
Moustafa Attia,
You got to my git account so you can figure out my contact info for more information.

ATTENTION !!!
This program/modules are all made exclusively for my own usage till I announce the open-sourcing. Using them in your project/business without informing me is considered bla bla bla xD. It's open-source don't worry :D.
